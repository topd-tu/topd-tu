- 👋 Hi, I’m @topd-tu
- 👀 I’m interested in building customized iso
- 🌱 I’m currently consuming phyton, javascript, linux, automation, AI, etc
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on writing a bootable iso/file customize for any user profile that fits your needs. From login in to account management - everything in one bootup! It's like a ledger, only you can use it.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
